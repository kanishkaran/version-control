This document outlines the process followed to initialize a Git repository, create and manage branches, make changes, and push updates to a remote repository.


Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

-Created a directory named version-control and initialized Git.
    * git init

-Created a folder named task1 and added a test file with content.

-Added and committed the initial file:
    * git add .
    * git commit -m "Add Initial Sample File"

-Connected the local repository to a remote repository and pushed changes:
    * git remote add origin https://github.com/kanishkaran/version-control.git
    * git push origin master


Step 2: Create and Work on a New Branch

-Created a new branch and switched to it:
    * git checkout -b new-feature

-Made changes to the test file and committed the changes:
    * git add .
    * git commit -m "Make Change in Test File"

Step 3: Merge Changes to Main Branch

-Switched back to the main branch:
    * git checkout master

-Merged the new-feature branch into main:
    * git merge new-feature


Step 4: Push Merged Changes to Remote Repository

-Pushed the updated main branch to the remote repository:
    * git push origin master

-Verified:
    * git log --oneline

    Output-
        e980563 (HEAD -> main, origin/master, new-feature) Make Change in Test File
        04ca7c6 Add Initial Sample File
