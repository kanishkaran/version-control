# Using .gitignore and Tracking Files

## Objective  
- Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files or directories from version control. 
- Verify that ignored files are not tracked by Git. 

## Requirements  
- Create a `.gitignore` file with patterns to ignore specific files (e.g., log files, temporary files). 
- Add files that match and do not match the ignore patterns. 
- Use Git commands to confirm which files are being tracked.
