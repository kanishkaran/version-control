This document outlines the process followed to create a new branch, modify files in both branches, merge changes, and resolve conflicts in a Git repository.  

Step 1: Create and Add Task-4 Directory  
- Created the task-4 folder and added it to Git:  
    ```
    mkdir task-4
    git add task-4
    ```  

Step 2: Create and Commit the Initial HTML File  
- Navigated to task-4 and created `index.html`:  
    ```
    cd task-4
    code index.html
    ```  
- Added the following content to `index.html`:  
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a Sample Document</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
- Added and committed the file:  
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add initial index.html file"
    ```  

 Step 3: Create and Modify in a New Branch  
- Created a new branch and switched to it:  
    ```
    git checkout -b new_branch
    ```  
- Modified `index.html` in the new branch:  
    ```html
    <body>
        <p>This is a Sample Document</p>
        <p>This is modified in the new Branch</p>
    </body>
    ```
- Added and committed the changes:  
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add modified file from new branch"
    ```  

Step 4: Modify in the Master Branch  
- Switched back to the master branch:  
    ```
    git checkout master
    ```  
- Modified `index.html` in master:  
    ```html
    <body>
        <p>This is a Sample Document</p>
        <p>This is modified in the master Branch</p>
    </body>
    ```
- Added and committed the changes:  
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add Modified File from master Branch"
    ```  

Step 5: Merge and Resolve Conflict  
- Attempted to merge `new_branch` into `master`, which resulted in a conflict:  
    ```
    git merge new_branch
    ```  
- Resolved the conflict manually by combining changes from both branches:  
    ```html
    <body>
        <p>This is a Sample Document</p>
        <p>This is modified in the new Branch</p>
    </body>
    ```
- Added and committed the resolved file:  
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolved Conflict"
    ```
