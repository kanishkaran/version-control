# Stashing Changes for Context Switching

## Objective  
Learn how to use Git stash to save uncommitted work temporarily.

## Requirements  
1. Make changes in your working directory without committing.  
2. Use `git stash` to save these changes.  
3. Switch branches, perform some work, then return and reapply your stashed changes with `git stash pop`.  
4. Optionally, demonstrate how to view and manage multiple stashes using `git stash list` and `git stash drop`.
